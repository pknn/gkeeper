# Greenhouse Keeper
Greenhouse Keeper is a website application about the greenhouse.

**Website:** https://gkeeper.project.pknn.dev

## *Overview*
We will measure and collect the data of brightness and temperature in the greenhouse. Then, we will use the stored data from our measure and the outsourced API about weather and plants to compute values for using it to balancing the environment of the close area that suit the plants.

## *Motivation*
We want to do this project because we think it interesting to using the sensors with microcontroller board to find and collect the data. After the brainstorm, it should be work with planting in greenhouse when we using light intensity and temperature sensors.
Also after researching, there is no available API providing enough data that might be useful for agriculture. So the data collected from this project can be used for it too.
